### 🔧 Currently hacking on
- An e-commerce app because shipping things is fun.
- A few internal tools in my personal dev lab.  
- Figuring out how AI can actually help engineers (without stealing our jobs).  
- Contributing to [siswoyo-dev/redis-prayer-times](https://github.com/siswoyo-dev/redis-prayer-times) — location-aware prayer schedule (via fork: [putrarp/redis-prayer-times](https://github.com/putrarp/redis-prayer-times)).

### 🧪 Currently learning
- Exploring GenAI for dev workflows & automation.  
- Always poking around new tools in my lab.

---

### 🧿 Homelab / Self-hosting
- Proxmox VE for my self-hosted stack and playground apps.  
- Because renting the cloud is cool—but owning your uptime is cooler. 

---

### 🤝 Available for
- Talks, memes, **side projects**, code reviews,  
  or just ranting about that one bug that only happens on Fridays.
